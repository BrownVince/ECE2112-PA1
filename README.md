## ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM
At the first problem, I tried to sort normal words, and it turned out perfectly fine. But when I added capital letters and symbols, it did not sort out the way I wanted it to be, the capital letters came first before the lower case letters. So I've put a function that makes the word all lowercase and a function that removes symbols so that only the alphabets will be sorted out.
## EMOTICON PROBLEM
In the second code, I first tried to separate the words into lists, then loop the list in order to find the words i want to replace, but in the end, I encountered problems in where to store it, and when I figured out where to store it, i encountered a problem again in the space between the words, hence i resorted to the most basic replace function.
## UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM
In the last problem, I first used the most basic code which is to use index and print as it is, but I thought it was very common, so I made an alternative code and added a little twist to it which is to make use of for loop to find the middle elements.
